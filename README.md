# ytrss 📺

A fast and lightweight TUI tool for browsing and watching YouTube subscriptions via RSS, directly in your terminal. Built for Linux with the Unix philosophy in mind.

Designed to work seamlessly with [QuickTube](https://github.com/coffe/QuickTube) (or other video players).

## ✨ Features

*   **Blazing Fast:** Fetches all RSS feeds asynchronously (concurrently) at startup.
*   **Clean TUI:** Navigate easily with arrow keys and search/filter by typing directly in the menu.
*   **Shorts Handling:** Automatically identifies Shorts (< 60s) and lets you toggle their visibility instantly.
*   **Smart:** Tracks watched videos and caches video durations in a local SQLite database.
*   **OPML Support:** Easily import/export your subscriptions.
*   **Portable:** Builds into a single standalone binary with no dependencies.

## 🚀 Installation

### Option 1: Build from Source (Recommended)
You only need Python 3 installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/coffe/ytrss.git
cd ytrss
./build.sh
```

This creates an executable in `dist/ytrss`. Copy it to your `$PATH`:

```bash
cp dist/ytrss ~/bin/  # or /usr/local/bin/
```

## 🎮 Usage

Start the program:

```bash
ytrss
```

### Menu Shortcuts
*   **`Up/Down`**: Navigate the list.
*   **`Enter`**: Select channel or play video.
*   **`Type text`**: Filter the list instantly (e.g., type "linux" to see only Linux-related channels/videos).
*   **`r`**: Refresh feeds.
*   **`m`**: Mark all videos as seen.
*   **`s`**: Show/Hide Shorts (toggle).
*   **`a`**: Add a new RSS link.
*   **`d`**: Delete a channel.
*   **`q`**: Quit.

## ⚙️ Configuration
All data is stored in `~/.config/ytrss/`:
*   `ytRss.opml`: Your subscriptions.
*   `ytrss.db`: Database with history and metadata.

## 🔧 Requirements
*   Python 3.8+
*   `yt-dlp` (for fetching video durations/metadata).
*   `wl-copy` (Wayland) or `xclip` (X11) for clipboard handling.
