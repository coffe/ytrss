# ytrss 📺

A fast and lightweight TUI tool for browsing and watching YouTube subscriptions via RSS, directly in your terminal. Built for Linux with the Unix philosophy in mind.

Designed to work seamlessly with [QuickTube](https://github.com/coffe/QuickTube) (or other video players).

## ✨ Features

*   **Blazing Fast:** Fetches all RSS feeds asynchronously (concurrently) at startup.
*   **Watch Later Playlist:** Save videos to a local "Watch Later" list directly from the interface.
*   **Clean TUI:** Navigate easily with arrow keys and search/filter by pressing `/`.
*   **Shorts Handling:** Automatically identifies Shorts (< 60s) and lets you toggle their visibility instantly.
*   **Smart:** Tracks watched videos and caches video durations in a local SQLite database.
*   **OPML Support:** Easily import/export your subscriptions.
*   **Portable:** Builds into a single standalone binary with no dependencies.

### Option 1: Build from Source (Recommended)
You only need Python 3 installed.
